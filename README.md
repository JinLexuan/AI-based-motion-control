# Multiple-UAV-motion-control-system
Multiple UAV motion control system(initially named as AI based motion control) is my EE5003 project for NUS.  
The code and result GIF is saved in this repository.  
The RRT path planning algorithm is based on this [adnanmunawar/matlab-rrt-variants](https://github.com/adnanmunawar/matlab-rrt-variants).
